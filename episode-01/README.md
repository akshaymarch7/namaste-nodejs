NodeJs - 01 : History of NodeJs

**What is Node.js?**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

-   Node.js is maintained by the **OpenJS** Foundation.  
    Node.js executes JavaScript code outside the web browser.
-   JavaScript is the language at the core of the web and browsers, but with Node.js, you can now run it everywhere. That’s why Node.js is often associated with the phrase **“Run JS everywhere.”**
-   Node.js has an event-driven architecture and is capable of asynchronous I/O **(non-blocking I/O)**
-   Node.js was built by **Ryan Dahl** in 2009.
-   To run JavaScript, you always need a JavaScript engine
-   Everywhere you write JavaScript code, there is a JavaScript engine that executes the code.
-   Ryan started with the **SpiderMonkey** JavaScript engine, which is found in Firefox. However, within two days, he switched to **V8** and never looked back.
-   Initially, **Ryan** was working independently, but a company named Joyent was working on something similar to Node.js. They hired **Ryan** to work under them, offering to fund his project — a big contribution from Joyent.
-   The original name of Node.js was **“web.js,”** but it was later renamed to “Node.js” because its scope extends beyond web servers.
-   The **Apache HTTP Server** was a blocking server, so Ryan wanted to create a non-blocking server. This is why **Node.js** is a **Non-blocking** I/O.
-   The advantage of a non-blocking server is that it can handle multiple requests with a smaller number of threads.
-   In **2010,** NPM was introduced. NPM is a package manager for Node.js. Node.js wouldn’t be as successful without NPM.
-   Initially, Node.js was built only for **macOS and Linux**, but in **2011**, it was also supported on Microsoft platforms.
-   In **2012**, **Isaac Z.** Schlueter started maintaining Node.js, he is also the creator of NPM.
-   In **2014**, **Fedor Indutny** developed a fork of **Node.js** named **io.js**, leading to controversy within the company. A few developers began maintaining the io.js branch.
-   In **2015**, Node.js and io.js were merged, forming the **Node.js Foundation.**
-   In **2019**, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the **OpenJS Foundation**, which currently maintains Node.js.
